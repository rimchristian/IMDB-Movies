# Movie Evaluation 

 I have completed an API Extraction Data Project using the IMDB movie dataset.  For this project, I will be creating a MySQL database. I will be using the database to analyze what makes a movie successful and will provide recommendations to the stakeholders on how to make a successful movie. 
 
 # These are the steps of creating the full Movie Project. 
 
 Part 1: Download several files from IMDBâ€™s movie data set and filter out the subset of moves requested by the stakeholder.
 Part 2: Use an API to extract box office revenue and profit data to add to your IMDB data and perform exploratory data analysis.
 Part 3: Construct and export a MySQL database using your data.
 Part 4: Apply hypothesis testing to explore what makes a movie successful.
