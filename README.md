# Movie Recommendations Report 
Main goal of this analysis is recommending what makes a movie successful and recommendations to the stakeholders on how to make a successful movie.  I will be creating a MySQL database to explore the data after extracting API data from the IMDB movie dataset. 

# File Import 
These are the files I will be exploring and filtering. 
1. importing the data from 'title.basics.tsv.gz'
    basics_url="https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.basics.tsv.gz"
 
2. importing the data from 'title.akas.tsv.gz'
    akas_url = 'https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.akas.tsv.gz'
   
3. importing the data from 'title.ratings.tsv.gz'
   ratings_url = 'https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.ratings.tsv.gz'
 

 
 
 # These are the steps of creating the full Movie Project. 
 
## Part 1: Downloaded the above files from the IMDB movie data set and filtered out the subset of moves requested by the stakeholder. 
## Part 2: Used APIs to extract box office revenue and profit data to add to my dataset and performed exploratory data analysis. 
## Part 3: Constructed and exported a MySQL database using the data. 
## Part 4: Applied hypothesis testing to explore what makes a movie successful. (A/B Testing)
