A deeply affecting and searing portrait, sibling filmmakers Laurie and David Shapiro capture a man in utter conflict, a fearless adventurer, and one of the most charming, enigmatic, and perplexing men ever captured on screen.",2.465,/oHR0KPt0RE74iy3WyGPEmfLPbJM.jpg,[],"[{'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]",2000-04-15,0.0,82.0,"[{'english_name': 'English', 'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}, {'english_name': 'Spanish', 'iso_639_1': 'es', 'name': 'Español'}]",Released,,Keep the River on Your Right: A Modern Cannibal Tale,0.0,6.4,17.0,R

One day they receive the utterly unexpected news that they are the sole inheritors of a wealthy neighbor, M. Guillemet, whom they have never met. Guillemet has left them his old townhouse along with all of his belongings, but with two conditions -- the first is that the dead man's papers be left untouched, and the second is that his live-in maid Clemence Richbourg remain employed at the estate. The Dorsets soon learn why they were the recipients of such strange generosity. Guillemet had set up a camera with a massive zoom lens pointing to their bedroom window.

The film's title refers to the name of a haute cuisine restaurant run by a self-satisfied conservative couple, Henri and Loretta. When the two find themselves overworked in the kitchen, they retreat to the local orphanage to find some cheap waitressing help, and the teenaged Diamantine fits the bill perfectly.

They are similar in many ways, all upper middle class professionals between 28 and 32 years of age, and very conscious of their psyche and lives. The diversity within the group however, is also remarkable. It's made up about half men and half women.

But when Ari meets Tiina (Laura Malmivaara), something unexpected happens - he falls in love. For the first time, Ari finds himself pursuing a long-term relationship, and he makes a genuine effort to remain faithful to her. But old habits die hard; Tiina introduces Ari to her circle of friends and temptation arises as he encounters Hanna-Riikka, a theology student, and Ilona, who is soon to be married. Despite Ari's feelings for Tiina, he begins having affairs with both Hanna-Riikka and Ilona, leading to an unpleasant revelation on the day of Ilona's nuptials. ~ Mark Deming, Allrovi",6.5280000000000005,/2MQyo1msG02u7MPZe3IxvmPOkgZ.jpg,"[{'id': 6339, 'logo_path': '/ufP8NkiJ9ScGLIKz7J25xKtmVvX.png', 'name': 'Solar Films', 'origin_country': 'FI'}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'FI', 'name': 'Finland'}]",2000-01-28,0.0,106.0,"[{'english_name': 'Finnish', 'iso_639_1': 'fi', 'name': 'suomi'}]",Released,,Restless,0.0,5.2,38.0,

Watson falls in love with the car, but real life quickly catches up to her in the form of the repo man when she falls behind on her monthly payments. To avoid losing her beloved wheels, Watson tries her hand at two of the oldest professions: waiting tables and phone sex. At the same time, her meddling best friend (Jamie Harrold), convinces Watson to ignite her stagnant love life by pursuing a sexually-phobic pilot (Gabriel Macht) and an aloof supermarket cashier (Glenn Fitzgerald).

Incorporating footage from John and Yoko's original film Imagine (clips of which were previously included in the 1988 documentary Imagine: John Lennon), Gimme Some Truth presents Lennon, Ono, coproducer Phil Spector, and a host of gifted musicians in a fluid context of conflict, community, and craftsmanship. Bearing witness to every stage of the recording process, this 63-minute documentary succeeds as a visual diary, a study of familiar music in its infancy, and a revealing portrait of the then-30-year-old Lennon--from witty clown to confrontational perfectionist--at the peak of his post-Fab Four inspiration.",2.237,/5kiJUXJFxc9aGxP58nga4z5htx3.jpg,"[{'id': 118016, 'logo_path': None, 'name': 'Andrew Solt Productions', 'origin_country': ''}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'GB', 'name': 'United Kingdom'}]",2000-04-11,0.0,63.0,"[{'english_name': 'English', 'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]",Released,,John Lennon - Gimme Some Truth,0.0,7.7,14.0,

In a provincial town, which is surrounded with nothing else but frost. It is bitterly cold weather — without snow. Even in this bewildered cold hundreds of people are standing around the circus tent, which is put up in the main square, to see — as the outcome of their wait — the chief attraction, the stuffed carcass of a real whale. The people are coming from everywhere. From the neighboring settlings, even from quite far away parts of the country. They are following this clumsy monster as a dumb, faceless, rag-wearing crowd. This strange state of affairs — the appearance of the foreigners, the extreme frost — disturbs the order of the small town.

Filmed live at the Zurich Opera House in February 2000 on a set which visualises the subtitle ""The School for Lovers"", the plot revolves around two army officers arguing about the fidelity of their brides, then setting out to test their chastity. Despite the often playful humour, this is not only psychologically telling music-making, but reveals Mozart exploring the structure of opera, discarding convention to mix large ensemble sections with arias for as many different combinations of singers as possible. With Liliana Nikiteanu attractively contrasted with Bartoli, and thoroughly convincing performances by Roberto Sacca (Ferrando) and Oliver Widmer (Guilelmo), this Così has a freshness and flow which, coupled with the timeless romantic themes, feels very contemporary.",1.4,/xTri2OieefujGWeVwyHPlCEGH1g.jpg,"[{'id': 79568, 'logo_path': None, 'name': 'Arthaus Musik', 'origin_country': 'DE'}, {'id': 79632, 'logo_path': None, 'name': 'RM Associates', 'origin_country': ''}]",[],2000-07-05,0.0,192.0,"[{'english_name': 'Italian', 'iso_639_1': 'it', 'name': 'Italiano'}]",Released,,Mozart: Così Fan Tutte (Zurich Opera House),0.0,0.0,0.0,

Amazingly, his sound is authentic Blues....and through it, we can hear the native roots, the origins of the Afro-centric rhythms found in Soul, Blues and Jazz!

Though not especially rich, she doles out money to street kids, in particular, a pretty young flower vendor named Oyuki, who becomes Aihara's godchild of sorts. Yet when a geisha (Reiko Takashima) from a rival red-light district insults Aihara and her brethren, she fights back. Soon an all-out geisha war looms.

Police pleaded that they were ‘terrorists’ and were so heavily-armed that arrest was impossible, They say that they had no option but to kill them all. A witness, however, sees a man shot with his hands up in the act of surrendering.

There is a startling dynamic energy, which contrasts powerfully with the more restrained interpretations by singers such as Emma Kirkby. Bartoli's natural Italian and the live atmosphere of Maria Grazia d'Alessio's oboe gives her interpretation of the quietly haunting and melodically rich ""Non ti Lusinghi la Crudeltade"" from Tito Manlio a particular piquancy.

The last segment is mainly a stamina test for both cardio and muscle endurance. Though the steps are more complicated, they are never very difficult.

Mr. Seed's parents are no longer alive; he has no family of his own and he is so focused on his impending death that he's forgotten how to live. Throughout the course of the film, the protagonist meets people whom he looks to for answers and advice.

A junkie who gets clean, a stroke survivor, a liberal rabbi, a band leader named ""Dethy,"" an old black man named Simon and a transvestite who has survived the AIDS epidemic are just some of the characters who color the film.

At least two of his students, Takasugi Shinsaku and Itō Hirobumi later became famous, and virtually all of the survivors of the Sonjuku group became officers in the Meiji Restoration. Takasugi led rifle companies against the shogun's army when it failed to conquer Chōshū in 1864, rapidly leading to the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Ito Hirobumi became Japan's first prime minister. His admirer, Maebara Issei, was later killed rebelling against the Meiji regime. He is now enshrined in Setagayaku-（世田谷区）Tokyo, Japan.",1.126,/wUDB6rttlg2ttJPVMxaXokkmOAl.jpg,"[{'id': 15505, 'logo_path': '/3MuBcEqLa5QRkZTpXBLzyk9zOmO.png', 'name': 'NHK', 'origin_country': 'JP'}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'JP', 'name': 'Japan'}]",2000-01-03,0.0,119.0,"[{'english_name': 'Japanese', 'iso_639_1': 'ja', 'name': '日本語'}]",Released,,Souten no Yume Shoin to Shinsaku Shin-seiki eno Chosen,0.0,0.0,0.0,
